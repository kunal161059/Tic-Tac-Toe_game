## Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was developed to enhance my understanding of JavaScript core concepts and 
apply them in a practical way.

## Description
The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a two-player game where players take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid with X and O symbols. The objective is to get three of the same symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or
diagonal row before the other player. The game ends in a draw if all spaces are filled without either player getting three in a row.


## Features

Interactive Gameplay: The game allows two players to take turns marking the grid with X and O symbols.
Win/Tie Detection: The game automatically detects when a player wins by getting three in a row or if the game ends in a tie.
Responsive Design: The game board and interface are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
Restart Game: Players can easily restart the game after a win or a tie.
